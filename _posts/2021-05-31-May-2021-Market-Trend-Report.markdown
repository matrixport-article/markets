### Summary

BTC Price Trend: Based on the 4 key BTC price indicators and data as of 31 May, BTC prices do not exhibit any clear trends.

Market Trends: 

-	More traditional firms are recognizing the growing importance of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment/store of value. With increasing utility and channels for cryptocurrencies, the asset is slowly shedding its reputation as an asset of pure speculation. In addition, more traditional finance giants are entering into the space, offering a bevy of crypto-centric products and services. These moves help to add a layer of legitimacy for the budding crypto industry.

Abnormal Activity Tracker: Due to power restrictions faced by the miners in the Sichuan province, the total hashrate fell sharply in the third week of May. In addition, the region is also undergoing a delay in the wet season, resulting in a decrease in electricity generation, making conditions unsuitable for Bitcoin mining. It is likely the hashrate will remain low till conditions in the region improve. No abnormal activity detected on the Ethereum blockchain. 

### BTC Price Trend

Based on the 4 key BTC price indicators and data as of 31 May, the BTC has reached a low point with the market in bear territory. The indicators suggest that the market has yet to form a clear trend and could easily move either direction. Overall:

- NVTS is a short-medium term bull/bear indicator. Current NVTS value is 51.8, on the low end of the scale, the lowest level it has been in months, therefore, it is likely BTC is slightly undervalued;

-	MVRV is a short-medium term bull/bear indicator. Current MVRV value is 1.86, around the mid-point of the scale, suggesting a lack of clear direction；

-	Mayer Multiple is currently 0.88, indicating that the market has entered into the bear territory, it remains unclear if the market is primed for a bounce back or will continue to stay in the bear territory for a longer period of time; 

-	Funding rate did not reach abnormal levels during May. No clear short-term price signals are provided.

As discussed per our previous report “Price Indicators Deep Dive and Bitcoin Price Analysis”, there are limitations to the aforementioned indicators, and these indicators should only serve as suggestions and not investment advice.

### Abnormal Activity Tracker

The Bitcoin network's hash rate has suffered a short-term loss as miners in China's Sichuan region are facing temporary power limitations. The State Grid in Sichuan's Aba county, one of the mountainous areas in the province that houses hydropower plants, issued a notice on May 16, requiring local energy-intensive enterprises to limit their power consumption as the province is currently facing a surging utility demand. Sichuan is undergoing a delay in the wet season, which decreases electricity generation, making conditions unsuitable for Bitcoin mining.
